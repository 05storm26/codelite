- add SVN options to workspace tree
- when editing a c++ file, add new menu entry in the menu bar, which includes all the editor's context menu
- make the "Start" page go away after a project has been loaded
- validate the environment variables
- Also a possible feature would be to popup a dialog if a $(var) is in a project and not defined already
