- Fix CC for files, by adding new table in the database which include all files scanned by CL

- Implement auto-hide feature for the Output pane, which does the following:

	2. When searching, show the pane, close it only when user press the 'x'
	3. Same as 2 for cscope

- Add bookmark tab to the bottom pane, it should always show the current file (should be in a form of tree)
  make it a plugin

- Auto detect workspace/project modified outside of the IDE and offer to re-load the workspace
