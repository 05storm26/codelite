- clang: make sure we don't attempt to track PP when the file is not a valid C++ file
- Installer: when installing codelite, make sure we override the 'registry.ini' file with the new file
- Installer: when un-installing codelite, remove the 'codelite' folder completly


- clang: CC does not work for headers (no flags in the database)
