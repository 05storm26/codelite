Important:
===========

- Open include file does not work for uppercase file
- Code completion of files names is not working for uppercase files (file name is made lower case)

BUGS:
=====

- clang: make sure we don't attempt to track PP when the file is not a valid C++ file
- Installer: when installing codelite, make sure we override the 'registry.ini' file with the new file
- Installer: when un-installing codelite, remove the 'codelite' folder completly

Subversion: 
- Fixed an error when adding a file which is "(bin)"
