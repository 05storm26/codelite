Code Completion / Code Generation
=================================

- code completion: better comment for ctor/dtor functions
- code completion: add a menu option for a class to implements all its parent interface functions
- code completion: add ctor function calltip... (its annoying!) NOTE: __constuct is not called by default. Only the child __construct should be called
- When typing inside 'require{_once}' auto complete file names
- code completion: add option to 'add include for ...'
- Must: SFTP: add a per file destination folder to allow overriding the global settings
- Better parsing for functions' return value
- Navigation Bar

Must:
=====
- Fix 'Outline' plugin to support PHP files
- Use the PHP include paths to the global PHP settings (so it will include ZF etc)
- When codelite shows the "XDebug failed to connect in a timely manner" -> add button to run xdebug diag tool

Usability:
==========
- Function calltip should include the return value
- Allow user to define a deployment folder for his files 
  (in addition to the SFTP, it should also allow user to copy files by simply saving them)
- Auto detect Zend Server if installed

NICE TO HAVE: 

- Watches
- Workspace view: make it multi selection
