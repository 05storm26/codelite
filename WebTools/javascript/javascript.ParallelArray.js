/**
 * @brief The goal of ParallelArray was to enable data-parallelism in web applications. The higher-order functions available on ParallelArray attempted to execute in parallel, though they may fall back to sequential execution if necessary. To ensure that your code executes in parallel, it is suggested that the functions should be limited to the parallelizable subset of JS that Firefox supports.
