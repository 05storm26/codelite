/**
 * @brief The IDBCursorSync interface of the IndexedDB API represents a cursor for iterating over multiple records in a database. You can have only one instance of IDBCursorSync representing a cursor, but you can have an unlimited number of cursors at the same time. Operations are performed on the underlying index or object store. It enables an application to synchronously process all the records in the cursor's range.
