 * @brief The once method is used to register a callback that will execute exactly once.Â  If the L10n context is ready when L10n.once() is called, the callback will be invoked immediately on the next tick of the event loop. If the L10n context is not ready when L10n.once() is called (because the localization resources are still downloading), the callback will be invoked when the ready event of the L10n context fires.
